                        <p>Dear God, I know You have so much You want to teach me. Help me to grow in my spirit so I can receive deeper truths from You. Teach me to listen, to understand, and to handle more of what You want to reveal so that I never miss anything You are saying. In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>

                    <p class="theme-scripture"><strong>Micah 7:18 (KJV):</strong> <em>Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not his anger forever, because he delighteth in mercy.</em></p>
                    <p class="golden-nugget"><strong>Golden Nugget:</strong> God finds great pleasure in doing good for His children. Kindness, goodness, and faithfulness are His specialty.</p>
                    <p class="Prayer"><strong>Prayer:</strong> Father, thank You for this word. I receive it with joy and embrace it through my day. I expect good things because it is Your desire. Goodness pursues and overtakes me. This day, great doors open for me in ways that I could never imagine; You connect me to destiny helpers; You intervene in long outstanding issues; You do me good! In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>

                    <h3 class="title">Kingdom Finance Principles: The Holy Spirit Makes The Difference</h3>
                    <p class="theme-scripture"><strong>Genesis 41:38 (KJV):</strong> <em>And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?</em></p>
                    <p class="golden-nugget"><strong>Golden Nugget:</strong> The Spirit of God in you is your greatest qualification for greatness and success. There are heights of wisdom that only the Holy Spirit can help you reach. Allow Him to work through you daily. May the people of this world see you and confirm that, indeed, you are not alone, but the Spirit of God functions through you.</p>
                    <p class="Prayer"><strong>Prayer:</strong>  Loving Father, thank You for Your Holy Spirit. I know that I have been sealed with Him forever. By Him, I do great things. He shows me truths, ideas, and solutions that an academic degree may never show me. He positions me as a source of answers in the world, to the glory of Your name. Amen.</p>

                    <h3 class="title">A New Way To Serve</h3>
                    <p class="theme-scripture"><strong>Romans 7:6 (AMPC):</strong> <em>But now we are discharged from the Law and have terminated all intercourse with it, having died to what once restrained and held us captive. So now we serve not under [obedience to] the old code of written regulations, but [under obedience to the promptings] of the Spirit in newness [of life].</em></p>
                    <p class="golden-nugget"><strong>Golden Nugget:</strong> Service under the grace dispensation is defined by obedience to the promptings of the Spirit. This means that as a believer under the grace dispensation, your service is primarily Spirit-led.</p>
                    <p class="Prayer"><strong>Prayer:</strong> Father, thank You for this word. Thank You for the privilege of serving You. The Bible says that as many as are led by the Spirit, they are the sons of God. May I never be found to labour in my own strength and by my wisdom.  May all my labours be dictated by Your grace and strength. In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
